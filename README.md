# multisig-wallet-w-delegation

A multisig wallet is a special wallet contract that releases funds (or any other assets stored) only when the majority of the key holders approve the transaction. Incorporating delegation for rights management reduces the friction for gaining the majority. With all the security of a conventional multisig wallet, this upgrade adds the flexibility to delegate the signing rights to a representative, thus saving time and money.
