# multisig-wallet-w-delegation

A multisig wallet is a special wallet contract that releases funds (or any other assets stored) only when the majority of the key holders approve the transaction. Incorporating delegation for rights management reduces the friction for gaining the majority. With all the security of a conventional multisig wallet, this upgrade adds the flexibility to delegate the signing rights to a representative, thus saving time and money.

> This project is a prototype and is not audited/optimized for industry needs. We do not recommend it to be used until the release of first beta version. However, we have limited resources so feel free to contribute with code, code review, design, bug reports, advice, documentation, or anything else you can think of.

> Also note that the contract has been deployed Polygon Mubai Testnet and can be verified here [0xD5F80a6C0431305c354FCC338627F4b492434Bf3](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xd5f80a6c0431305c354fcc338627f4b492434bf3). The security features of contract allows only the owner and assigned signers to interact with this contract. You would be required to deploy your own if interested to test. Feel free to contact for help.
